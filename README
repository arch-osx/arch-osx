Install the macosx package first. This is a dummy (empty) package but provides
dependencies from the Mac OS X host system. This means we can still use packages
that depend on things like bash or openssl.

We need to write bootstrap instructions.

Adding Packages
---------------

* cd packages
* svn mkdir <PACKAGE NAME>
* svn propset svn:ignore -F .svnignore <PACKAGE NAME>
